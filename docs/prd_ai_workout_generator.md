AI-Powered Workout Generator for Gyms: Product Requirements Document (PRD)
1. Introduction üöÄ
1.1. Product Vision
To empower gym owners and coaches with an intelligent, customizable platform that leverages AI to generate dynamic, personalized workouts, streamline gym operations, and enhance member engagement, fostering a healthier and more active community.

1.2. Problem Statement
Gyms often struggle with:

Manually creating diverse and engaging workout programs, which is time-consuming and limits trainer capacity.

Lack of tools to efficiently manage users, coaches, and track member progress in a unified, customizable system.

Difficulty in offering personalized experiences at scale, leading to decreased member retention.

Limited insight into gym and user performance metrics.

1.3. Solution Overview
Our application will provide a multi-tenant SaaS platform where gym owners (tenant admins) can manage their gym, coaches, and users, customize their branding, and access usage reports. Coaches will utilize an AI LLM to generate, customize, and assign daily workouts based on defined parameters, track user progress, and manage exercises. Users will access their assigned workouts, log results, and track personal benchmarks. A superuser will oversee subscription plans and platform governance.

7. Design System üé®
The application will adopt a modular and themeable design system to support multi-tenancy branding.

Core Principles:

Modularity: UI components are atomic and reusable.

Theming: Easily swap colors, fonts, and potentially component variations based on tenant settings.

Accessibility: Adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

Responsiveness: Mobile-first approach with graceful degradation for larger screens.

Consistency: Maintain a consistent user experience across the platform, with tenant branding applied only to specific aesthetic elements.

Key Components:

Color Palette: Base palette with defined primary, secondary, accent, success, warning, danger, and neutral colors. Tenant override for primary, secondary, accent.

Typography: Consistent font families, sizes, weights.

Spacing & Layout: Standardized spacing units, grid systems.

Common UI Elements: Buttons, inputs, forms, modals, tables, navigation components.

Branding Elements: Logo display component with tenant-specific upload, dynamically loaded.

Implementation:

Use a CSS-in-JS library (e.g., Emotion or Styled Components) to enable dynamic theme application from the backend.

Context API in React for theme propagation.

A centralized theme object/context that can be dynamically populated based on the authenticated tenant's settings (logo URL, color codes).

Base components that inherit theme values.

8. Backend Setup (Multi-Tenant & Scalable) ‚òÅÔ∏è
8.1. Multi-Tenancy Strategy: Shared Database, Shared Schema with tenant_id and RLS
Database Level:

All tenant-specific tables (e.g., gyms, users, coaches, workouts, exercises, subscriptions) will have a tenant_id column (UUID or Integer).

PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS) will be implemented to enforce strict data isolation. Policies will be defined on tables to ensure that queries initiated by a tenant_id can only access rows belonging to that tenant_id. This is critical for security.

Non-tenant-specific tables (e.g., superuser_plans, platform_terms_and_conditions) will not have tenant_id.

Application Level:

Upon tenant admin or user login, the tenant_id will be extracted from their authentication token (JWT payload).

This tenant_id will be injected into the request context and used by the ORM/database client for all subsequent queries to filter data.

Middleware will be used to ensure tenant_id is present and correctly applied for all tenant-scoped API calls.

Superuser Access: The superuser role will bypass RLS or use specific database roles/credentials that have broader access to manage all tenants and platform-level data.

8.2. Microservices Architecture (Initial / Phased)
While a full microservices architecture can be complex from the start, we'll design with modularity in mind to allow for future splitting into distinct services.

Core Services (Initial Monolith, with clear domain boundaries):

Auth Service: Handles user authentication (login, registration, password reset), token generation (JWTs), and potentially user/role management.

Gym Management Service: Manages gym details, tenant branding, subscription links, and tenant admin functions.

User & Coach Management Service: Manages users and coaches within a specific gym's context.

Workout & Exercise Service: Handles all workouts (creation, generation, assignment, logging, searching, archiving) and exercises (management, inactive status). This will include the LLM integration.

Subscription & Billing Service: Manages subscription plans, subscriptions, billing, and usage tracking. Integrates with Stripe.

Reporting Service: Gathers and aggregates usage data for both tenant and superuser reports.

Inter-Service Communication: Initially, internal module calls or simple HTTP API calls within a single Node.js application. As complexity grows, consider:

RESTful APIs: Standard HTTP for synchronous communication.

Message Queues (e.g., Google Pub/Sub): For asynchronous events (e.g., "workout generated" event, "user subscribed" event) to decouple services and improve scalability.

8.3. Database Schema Design Principles
Tenant ID: Every tenant-specific table has a tenant_id foreign key referencing the gyms table.

UUIDs for IDs: Use UUIDs for primary keys where practical to avoid sequential IDs and improve distribution in sharded environments (future consideration).

Indexing: Proper indexing on tenant_id and frequently queried columns.

Relationships: Clear foreign key relationships.

8.4. LLM Integration
The LLM will be integrated as an external API call (Google Gemini API) from the Workout & Exercise Service.

A dedicated module within this service will handle prompt engineering, API calls, and parsing of LLM responses.

Caching (e.g., Redis) can be explored for frequently generated workout types or exercise data used in prompts to reduce LLM API costs and latency.

8.5. API Design
RESTful API design with clear endpoints and HTTP methods.

JSON for request and response bodies.

Versioning (e.g., /api/v1/).

Thorough input validation on all API endpoints.
